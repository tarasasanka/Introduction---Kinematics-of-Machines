  "body": "### Theory of Machines.\r\nThe subject Theory of Machines may be defined as that branch of Engineering-science, which deals with the study\r\nof relative motion between the various parts of a machine, and forces which act on them. The knowledge of this subject\r\nis very essential for an engineer in designing the various parts of a machine.\r\n\r\n### Kinematics of Machine.\r\nKinematics of machines is a branch of Theory of Machines which deals with the study of relative motion of various elements of machine without taking into consideration the forces which act upon them.\r\n\r\n### Objectives.\r\n1. This course is intended to get knowledge on different types of links and pairs used in different Mechanisms.\r\n2. It also covers various types of inversions.\r\n\r\n### Outcomes:\r\n1. the viewers will get knowledge on how inversions obtained for different mechanisms.\r\n\r\n### Topics Covered:\r\n1. Machine, Mechanism and Structure.\r\n2. Kinematic Link and its Types\r\n3. Kinematic pairs and its Types\r\n4. Mobility of planar Mechanism\r\n5. Kinematic Chain and its Types\r\n6. Inversions of Kinematic Chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
